ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pavan Kumar, studying Mathematics in Science and Engineering at TUM. This is my new account, as the older one got frozen. I have worked as a machine learning engineer in the Erosita project at Zeiss and Max-Planck and am currently working at BMW.
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning and executing state-of-the-art technologies in real-world problems.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing real-world projects and learning how we can use technology to solve them.
